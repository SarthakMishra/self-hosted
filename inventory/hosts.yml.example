# Configuration Guide:
#
# COMPLETE SERVER SETUP (Recommended):
#   1. Edit ansible_host with your server IP: YOUR_SERVER_IP
#   2. Configure vault.yml with Tailscale auth key and Traefik settings
#   3. Run: ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/setup.yml
#   4. Done! Server ready with Docker + Traefik reverse proxy + SSL
#
# SSH User Configuration:
#   - ansible_user: ubuntu    # AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode (default)
#   - ansible_user: debian    # Debian images
#   - ansible_user: admin     # Custom setups
#   - ansible_user: root      # Direct root (not recommended)
#
# Important:
#   - Ubuntu user typically has passwordless sudo by default
#   - Use Tailscale IPs for secure networking when available
#   - Deploy apps with Traefik labels for automatic SSL and routing
